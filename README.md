# üå§Ô∏è Weather Agent Chat Interface 

[Weather Agent Chat](https://weather-chat-delta.vercel.app/)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SidW111/weather-chat)


A responsive chat application that connects to the **Weather Agent API** and allows users to query weather information in a conversational format.

---

## My Approach

Step 1: Set up a basic Next.js app with Tailwind CSS.

Step 2: Integrated Weather Agent API using fetch with streaming response handling.

Step 3: Built a responsive chat layout with message bubbles.

Step 4: Managed chat state with useState and auto-scroll using useRef.

Step 5: Implemented Dark/Light mode and smooth animations for polish.

Step 6: Added UX improvements :- loading states, error handling, input disable during API calls.

Step 7: Implemented Export chat functionality.

Step 8: Implemented Responsiveness for all devices.
